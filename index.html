    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
    <p>The Picture Locator is an quiz app that quizzes the user by presenting a series of pictures and subsequently asking
    the user to determine the location where the picture was taken on a map. The user is scored based on the accuracy of his/her guesses.
    This app supports multiple users, and users can upload their own pictures to the cloud. The app will generate questions based on the
    pictures uploaded to the cloud. The app will support two modes, the Dartmouth mode and the worldwide mode. The Dartmouth mode will focus on quizing
    Darmtouth users with the location in Darmtouth College. The worldwide mode will target locations all around the world.
